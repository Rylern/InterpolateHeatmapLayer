# InterpolateHeatmapLayer

InterpolateHeatmapLayer is a minimalist JavaScript library for rendering temperature maps (or interpolate heatmaps) with [Mapbox GJ JS](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/guides/). This library was greatly inspired by the [temperature-map-gl](https://github.com/ham-systems/temperature-map-gl) library and depends on [Earcut](https://github.com/mapbox/earcut).

Please refer to the [GitHub README](https://github.com/Rylern/InterpolateHeatmapLayer#readme) for full documentation.
